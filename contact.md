## Slack

We have a Slack workspace that you can get an invite to. Currently, you'll have to send us a mail to get the link.

## GitHub

You can and should [create an issue on our GitHub](https://github.com/lauriszz123/Neon-Machine/issues/new) if you want to contact us about a problem or an error in the program. But don't use this for general questions or private messages - issues are public and everyone can see them!

Also, please make sure the issue hasn't been raised before - use the search bar before you post.
