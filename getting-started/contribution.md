# Contributing

In this section, we will cover the different ways you can contribute to the project. If you want to help in another way, not listed here, feel free to [contact us](../contact.md).

We are happy to get help, and appreciate anything! But don't _expect_ to get put in the credits - we will decide who have done enough to deserve a shout-out ~~although we're quite generous with it~~.

## Development

If you want to help with the coding, first off create a GitHub account. After that, follow these steps:

1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/lauriszz123/Neon-Machine) ![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%281%29.png)
2. Commit and push your changes
3. Ensure that you are up-to-date with the master \([help](http://lmgtfy.com/?iie=1&q=git+rebase+fork)\)
4. Make a Pull Request \(PR\) with a short \(or long, if you really want\) description of your changes

After that, wait for someone to approve the PR.

If you plan on contributing a lot with development, you can also [request to join our slack](../contact.md#slack).

## Advertising

If you want to tell your friends in your favorite Discord channel about this project or post it on MySpace, you're more than welcome to! But please don't spam people ;\)

If you feel like you've done a great job spreading the word, feel free to [contact us](../contact.md#email) and tell us about your efforts!

## Documentation

Did you find a spelling error or do you wanna add a whole new section? Send us the text/pictures/etc., including a link to the page if it's an edit, and we'll put it in!

## Testing

Just by downloading and using Neon Machine you are helping us by testing out the functionality - if you found a bug or have a suggestion, it'd be really helpful to [make an issue about it](../contact.md#github).
