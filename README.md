# LuaOS
A simple "Virtual Machine" built with Love2D and Lua for all devices.

## TODO:
* **Slow rendering**  Need to make that all the rendering would be done on GPU not the CPU
* Virtual CPU speed is fixed, need to calculate that and determine when to slow down the program.
* Need to add networking.
* Need to add HTML stuff.

## Known bugs:
None at the moment.

## Who can contribute?
Everyone who wants to make this **project** a reality!
